			Several churches in the South decided to hold union services. The leader was a Baptist and proud of his denomination. "How many Baptists are here?" he asked on the first night of the revival? All except one little old lady raised their hands. "Lady, what are you?" asked the leader. "I'm a Methodist," meekly replied the lady. "Why are you a Methodist?" queried the leader? "Well," replied the little old lady, "my grandparents were Methodists, my mother was a Methodist, and my late husband was a Methodist." "Well," retorted the leader, "just supposing all your relatives had been morons, what would that have made you?" "Oh, I see. A Baptist, I suppose," the lady replied meekly.

		<p>once upon a time, in the land of Zo, there was a boy named Yhtrod. Yhtrod had a big cat named Otot. So once, while he was in Zo, just cruisin' around in his flying house, he made a very bad landing, and landed directly on top of the good Wizard of the East. Of course the good wizard didn't die (obviously because he was a wizard), so Yhtrod joined up with a scared crow, a fearless wolf, and a titanium woman. Together they went down the cobblestone path, to defeat the evil witch of Zo. But they failed, and they all died. </p><p>The End!</p>
		<p>In case you didn't notice, that was the opposite of a popular story, and you probably know which one. If you can't tell which story it is, you will have to figure out. :D</p>
