	<hr>

	<p>once upon a time, in the land of Zo, there was a boy named Yhtrod. Yhtrod had a big cat named Otot. So once, while he was in Zo, just cruisin' around in his flying house, he made a very bad landing, and landed directly on top of the good Wizard of the East. Of course the good wizard didn't die (obviously because he was a wizard), so Yhtrod joined up with a scared crow, a fearless wolf, and a titanium woman. Together they went down the cobblestone path, to defeat the evil witch of Zo. But they failed, and they all died. </p><p>The End!</p>
	<p>In case you didn't notice, that was the opposite of a popular story, and you probably know which one. If you can't tell which story it is, you will have to figure out. :D</p>

	<h1 class = "intros">Division by zero</h1>	
	<hr>

	<p>Just for fun, I'm going to try to convince you of something that is not true.
	So here I go. If you have done much math, you have probably heard that division by zero is not allowed. But I am now going to tell you, what the result of division by zero is.
	So let's start by division by positive numbers. if I were to divide 1 by 2, I would get 1/2. If I divided 1 by 4, I would get 1/4. Likewise, 1 divided by 1000, is 1/1000. Notice the pattern here? the larger the number you divide by (the denominator), the smaller the result. So the larger the bottom number, the smaller the result.</p>
	<p>How about if I divied by a fraction? Well, if I divided 1 by 1/2, I would get 2*. If I divided 1 by 1/4, I would get 4, If I divided 1 by 1/1000, I would get 1,000. And if I divided 1 by 1/1,000,000,000,000,000, I would get 1,000,000,000,000,000. </p><img src="images/zero.jpg.jpg"><p> Get the picture? the smaller the fraction you divide by, the larger the result. The reason this is important, is because the smaller the fraction is, the closer it is to zero, and the closer the fraction you divide by is, to zero, the closer the result is, to.... Infinity. That's right, zero, is basically, an Infinitely small fraction, and when we divide by an infinitely small fraction, we get an infinitely large number. So anything divided by zero, is infinity.</p>
	<img src="images/zero2.jpg">

	<p>*In case you don't know, the reason that 1 divided by 1/2 equals 2, is because dividing by a fraction, is the same as multiplying by that same fraction fliped over, so 1 divided by 1/2, is the same as 1 times 2/1. and 2/1, is the same as 2. So 1 divided by 1/2 is the same as 1 * 2.</p>

	<h1 class = "intros">A&nbsp;story&nbsp;about&nbsp;Timmy&nbsp;(and&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant)</h1>

	<hr>

	<div class = "post">
	<p>Now, in the first year of king Bob, son of Tom, son of Swangshniggle, son of bobby Sr. son of a guy, there was a person. Now this person was pretty normal. He had eyes and a nose, and a leg. Yes, only one leg. He wasn't completely normal.</p> <P> Anyway, as I was saying, This one legged guy (named Timmy) was out in Giant country alone one day, just Hopping along, when he saw a person. Now Timmy thought that everyone had only one leg, but this person had two legs. Now timmy thought that this two legged guy was ugly, on account of having two legs. However, this two legged guy was the king: king Bob.</p>
	<p>So Timmy said "Yo dude! you be pretty ugly." But the king didn't like people calling him ugly. So he said "Gaurds! Kill him!!!" Problem was, there were no gaurds with him. they were all too scared of the giants in giant country. Because there were giants in giant country. And right at that moment, a giant heard the king's loud yelling and crying (the king was crying now, because timmy had said that he was ugly) Anyway. The giant heard him, and came over there with his spiky club.</p>
	<p>King Bob was scared. No, he was Terrified. but Timmy was not scared. Or terrified. He looked that Giant in the eye, and said "Hi". Now this Giant had only one eye (that is why Timmy looked him in the "eye". Technically he was a cyclops. now this Cyclops was a decendent of the great cyclops Rhimborger the terrifying. Rhimborger was a normal giant who got into a fight, and got one of his eyes poked out, and now all his decendents had only one eye. But I am getting off track now</p>
	<p>Anyway. Timmy wasn't afraid of him, because he had only one eye, and The giant (named winkbeegler) was not afraid of Timmy, because he had only one leg. So Winkbeegler said "Dude, you be one cool looking guy!" How bout you bring your cow to my castle, so we can eat him for dinner. He was refering to king Bob. but timmy said "Actually, that is a person, just like me. He just resembles a cow... " So the Giant let his buddy Timmy go, along with the king, and king Bob promised Timmy anything he wanted for saving his life, and Timmy lived happily ever after. Until the next day. And the king lived the rest of his life, being terrified that Giant Winkbeegler would come and kill him.</p>
	<p>The Almost end!</p>
	<h2>Epilogue </h2>
	<p>In the course of human events, it becomes necesary for score of seven years ago, to bring forth this great Nation. With liberty and Justice for all. Except, as it turns out, Timmy. You probably remember Timmy, he was the one armed guy.... Wait. One <em>legged</em>. Right. So Timmy was busy living happily ever after, with a whole bunch of Gold that the king had given him, but since he was not too experienced with living the luxourous life, he didn't know what to do with the money</p>
	<p>So what he did, was he asked his giant friend, Winkbeegler, to cary all the gold, to a remote mountain top. Then, he asked his friend Flingflabble, to breathe fire on it, and melt it. Flingflabble was a dragon. Then Timmy Made a castle out of it. a solid Gold castle</p>
	<p>Now here is where Timmy doesn't get Liberty and Justice. In fact, Timmy Doesn't get liberty or Justice. What happend was, Timmy was living in his golden castle, which he called "The Castle For People With One Of Something That Most People Have Two Of." Of course, that is kind of long, so normally he abbreviated it as <b>TCFPWOOSTMPHTO</b> After one month, there were 100 people living at <b>TCFPWOOSTMPHTO</b> Including, but not limited to, Tingapingfiggle, Blobnose the Blob, Stinky feet Shtinkle, Fanglebobbles, and Captain Shingledoos. Together, they made a Fearsome army. Now, as the story is thus far, it seems that Timmy is actually doing pretty good. But the problem was, The ordinary people: the people with two arms, and two legs, etc. Those "ordinary" people, didn't like them.</p>
	<p>You are probably wondering why I put, ordinary, in quotes. The reason is, that from the point of view of of timmy, and his friends in <b>TCFPWOOSTMPHTO</b>, They themselves were ordinary, but to the rest of the world, Timmy and his friends were the weirdos. Now I must call attention to one point. Technically speaking, most people have two legs, two arms, two eyes, etc. Therefore, in the technical sense of the word, timmy and his friends were weird, and the rest of the world were ordinary. So from this point on, I will refer to the people who do not live in <b>TCFPWOOSTMPHTO</b>, as the ordinary people.</p>
	<p> Now you are also probably wondering, why the epilogue, is longer than the main story. well, the answer is... Because that's how I made it! I have complete power over this story, so I can do whatever I want. So stop criticising everything I do!.</p>
	<p>now. where was I? Oh yes. The ordinary people didn't like timmy and his band of hoolagins (I will henceforth refer to them as "the weirdos" So. the ordinary people came to try to kill all the weirdos, They marched up to the gates of the Golden castle, and Then......</p>
